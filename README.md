# 🧠 Algorithm Practice in Python

Welcome to my personal repository for practicing **algorithms and data structures** in **Python**. This is a long-term project where I solve problems during my free time, mainly using **GeeksforGeeks** and **LeetCode** as learning resources.

## 📁 Repository Structure

The repository is organized by topic, with each folder containing Python scripts related to a specific algorithmic concept:




Each file includes:
- A short **problem description**
- A **Python implementation**
- Optional **comments and explanations**
- Example input/output or test case(s)

---

## 🎯 Goals

- Improve algorithmic thinking and problem-solving skills
- Write clean, efficient, and well-commented Python code
- Reinforce key concepts in data structures and algorithms
- Build a strong foundation for coding interviews and competitions
