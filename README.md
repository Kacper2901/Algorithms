# 🧠 Algorithm Practice in Python

Welcome to my personal repository for practicing **algorithms and data structures** in **Python**.  
This is a long-term project where I solve problems during my free time, mainly using  
[**GeeksforGeeks**](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/) and [**LeetCode**](https://leetcode.com/) as learning resources.

## 📝 Learning Methodology

To improve retention and speed, I follow a **two-day practice loop**:

- 🧩 **Day 1**: I think through several problems, focusing on understanding the logic and attempting to solve them.
- ⚙️ **Day 2**: I try to **implement the solutions from scratch**, without looking at my previous notes –  
  typically inside the `test.py` file. This helps me verify if I truly understand the problem  
  and improves my **speed and fluency** in coding.

## 📁 Repository Structure

The repository is organized by topic.  
Each folder contains Python scripts related to a specific algorithmic concept.

Each file typically includes:

- ✅ A short **problem description**
- 🐍 A complete **Python implementation**
- 💬 Optional **comments and explanations**
- 🧪 Example **input/output or test case(s)**

---

## 🎯 Goals

- 💡 Improve **algorithmic thinking** and **problem-solving skills**
- ✨ Write **clean**, **efficient**, and **well-commented** Python code
- 🔁 Reinforce **key concepts** in data structures and algorithms
- 🧠 Build a strong foundation for **coding interviews** and **competitions**
